### Hi there 👋 I am Leif 

- 🔭 I'm currently working mainly on multiple Solidity Projects for Polychain Monsters 🐉 
- 🌱 I’m experimenting and contributing in different fields that I see as the future of Ethereum (L2, zkML, onchain gaming) and Bitcoin (ordinals)
- 👨‍💻 My passion within web3 is the NFT space. In the last years I contributed to a NFT-marketplace, a NFT-lending protocol, a bridge with NFT-bridging capabilities and to a NFT protocol on Bitcoin.
- trying to bring web3 to the people instead of people to web3

- :bulb: I think Onchain Games might be the next big thing for me and I try to build and learn as much as possible in this domain. With L2s/L3s we increasingly get gas efficient enough for full onchain functionality. Even for simpler games there are some unsolved problems, but that's what makes it interesting, innit ?
